00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Once upon a time not so long ago

00:10.000 --> 00:20.000
Tommy used to work on the docks, union's been on strike
He's down on his luck... it's tough, so tough

00:20.000 --> 00:30.000
Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man, she brings home her pay
For love, for love

00:30.000 --> 00:40.000
She says we've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not

00:40.000 --> 00:50.000
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot

00:50.000 --> 01:00.000
Woah, we're half way there
Woah, livin' on a prayer

01:00.000 --> 01:10.000
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Woah, livin' on a prayer

01:10.000 --> 01:20.000
Tommy's got his six string in hock
Now he's holding in what he used to make it talk

01:20.000 --> 01:30.000
So tough, it's tough
Gina dreams of running away

01:30.000 --> 01:40.000
When she cries in the night
Tommy whispers, "Baby, it's okay, someday..."

01:40.000 --> 01:50.000
We've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not

01:50.000 --> 02:00.000
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot

02:00.000 --> 02:10.000
Woah, we're half way there
Woah, livin' on a prayer

02:10.000 --> 02:20.000
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Woah, livin' on a prayer

02:20.000 --> 02:30.000
Livin' on a prayer

02:30.000 --> 02:40.000
Ooh, we've got to hold on, ready or not

02:40.000 --> 02:50.000
You live for the fight when that's all that you've got

02:50.000 --> 03:00.000
Woah, we're half way there
Woah, livin' on a prayer

03:00.000 --> 03:10.000
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Woah, livin' on a prayer

03:10.000 --> 03:20.000
Woah, we're half way there
Woah, livin' on a prayer

03:20.000 --> 03:30.000
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Woah, livin' on a prayer

03:30.000 --> 03:40.000
Woah, we're half way there
Woah, livin' on a prayer

03:40.000 --> 03:50.000
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Woah, livin' on a prayer

03:50.000 --> 04:08.000
Woah, livin' on a prayer (fade out)
